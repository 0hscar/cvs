## Requires: (For game controls)
- Head tracking and/or Eye tracking, probably easier with third party
- Dataset which includes motions and gestures.
- Actions requiring gestures and/or motions (so far):
-- Camera control (Done with head and/or eye tracking)
-- Light attack
-- Heavy attack
-- Parry
-- Block
-- Dodge
-- Movement
-- Item usage (eg. Potions / food - Witcher 3)
-- Skills (eg. Signs - Witcher 3)


## Addons
Voice recognition would probably be more optimal for diverse interactions, opening menues etc.
Would be a DIY case, trained on my own voice.
