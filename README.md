# CVS (Computer Vision System)

Gesture recognition shenanigans turned to a probably more general computer vision system / shenanigans / thing for I don't even know what.
Correction: For Game controls, All actions, movements, camera controls etc. Voice recognition for Menu controls + interactions ? 

Includes modules for: (at the moment)
- Image processing
- Model training
- Gesture recognition
